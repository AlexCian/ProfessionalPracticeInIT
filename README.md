# Professional Practice In IT (Fletnix)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.5.

## Running App

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Initiate node/express with node ./server.js in BackEnd folder. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Navigation

The header up top has all of the desired links for you to go to on the website in button forms.

## Main Project

The project runs off the server and is fully loaded on startup (no loading time between pages) due to express.

This project is an Angular and Express project that is a movie and TV program watchlist. It is a full website with a home page, featured programs, items to purchase such as boxsets, a fully functioning cart page and a support page to view the FAQ and send off forms for technical assistance. It is mainly for broadcasting and previews of popular TV shows (an informative website) with some functionality. 

The main goal of the project is to broadcast all the necessary information people want to see about TV programs. Having too much content is unnecessary so we have developed a website with just the right amount of content and a very suitable UI for customers.
