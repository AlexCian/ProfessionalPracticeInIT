# Professional Practice In IT (FiNite)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.5.

## Running App (Important)

Run `ng serve` in MainProject directory. Initiate node/express with "node ./server.js" in BackEnd folder in code editor.

If you have cloned the project directly, in the MainProject folder you need to run:

npm install -g @angular/cli

npm install --save @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations

npm install express --save 

npm install mongoose

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Navigation

The header up top has all of the desired links for you to go to on the website in button forms.

## Main Project

The project runs off the server and is fully loaded on startup (no loading time between pages) due to express.

This project is an Angular and Express project that is a movie and TV program watchlist. It is a full website with a home page, featured programs, items to purchase such as boxsets, a fully functioning cart page and a support page to view the FAQ and send off forms for technical assistance. It is mainly for broadcasting and previews of popular TV shows (an informative website) with some functionality. 

The main goal of the project is to broadcast all the necessary information people want to see about TV programs. Having too much content is unnecessary so we have developed a website with just the right amount of content and a very suitable UI for customers.

## Home Page

An informative page giving the viewers an idea of who created their website and the ideas behind creating it.

## Featured

A page featuring some of the most popular released series and movies so that viewers can watch trailers for them and stream them. 

## Movies

A page showing movies that release soon so people can keep tabs on them and movies that release later in the year so that they can pre-order spots to watch it on live-stream through the website!

## Shop

A page showing items that can be bought from the store such as movies, boxsets, blu-rays and other accessories.

## Support

A technical assistance page allowing people on the website to send tickets to the support team if they have any issues with something on the website and a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) so that they can get a more rapid response from some of the most common queries.
