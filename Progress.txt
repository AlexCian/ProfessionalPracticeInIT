21st February : New Start Date as idea and technology of App have been changed. Fire Base and Angular will be used instead
of HTML and JavaScript.

22nd February 13:35pm : Fire Base has been set up with the new App. App needs major cleaning due to it being based off a previous
project which has no correlation to the idea of the current App. Can't be uploaded to Github until it is cleaned.

27th February 16:15pm : Attempting to iron out basic firebase changes, in process of pushing to git to test changing. 

27th February 16:27pm : Github working correctly, all work pushed to here. App still needs cleaning, hasn't been changed much as Firebase had some difficulties. 

1st March 11:51pm : Updated the Github repository for the main html page on Angular to have suitable CSS/the old look that other website had before idea was changed.

1st March 11:57pm : Wiki has been updated, index page link for Fire Base has been created and headers were added. Still in learning process of the Wiki so again it will be updated once more content has been added.
