21st February : New Start Date as idea and technology of App have been changed. Fire Base and Angular will be used instead
of HTML and JavaScript.

22nd February 13:35pm : Fire Base has been set up with the new App. App needs major cleaning due to it being based off a previous
project which has no correlation to the idea of the current App. Can't be uploaded to Github until it is cleaned.

27th February 16:15pm : Attempting to iron out basic firebase changes, in process of pushing to git to test changing. 

27th February 16:27pm : Github working correctly, all work pushed to here. App still needs cleaning, hasn't been changed much as Firebase had some difficulties. 

1st March 11:51pm : Updated the Github repository for the main html page on Angular to have suitable CSS/the old look that other website had before idea was changed.
-----------------------------
WORK FOR NEXT WEEK (4th March)
-----------------------------
Get suitable user interface, try and read/write from firebase database if possible, if not just work on website itself and have some usable functions inside.
