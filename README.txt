Professional Practice in IT project brief by Alex Cherry and Cian Doyle. 

The aim of this project collaboration is to create an easily accessible television program watchlist for
users who wish to watch, favourite or add to queue their selected television programs. It will be done so using Angular 
and Firebase.
There will be a sign up and login function using text files that save the data into them and confirm login data.
Each user will have specified programs added to their watchlist so they can be differentiated and different usernames.

The main idea of this is to use Firebase to create the database in for the TV programs and to pull them onto the Angular
app.
