Professional Practice in IT project brief by Alex Cherry and Cian Doyle. 

The aim of this project collaboration is to create an easily accessible television program watchlist for
users who wish to watch, favourite or add to queue their selected television programs. It will be done so using HTML5 
and JavaScript. 
There will be a sign up and login function using text files that save the data into them and confirm login data.
Each user will have specified programs added to their watchlist so they can be differentiated and different usernames.

The main idea of this project is to have Server/Client for a MySql database on a virtual machine that will be pulled and
used for the database of TV programs.
